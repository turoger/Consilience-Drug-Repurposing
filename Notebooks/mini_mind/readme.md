# Notes
The notebooks in this folder highlight the hyperparameter optimization process, and the resulting parameters for each knowledge graph embedding model on a miniturized drug repurposing dataset MIND ([mini-MIND](./01_Create_minimal_MIND.ipynb)). For context, MIND is a a dataset that seeks to recapitulate important relationships describing a drug mechanism. The miniturization process follows previously described papers ([Rivas](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/23/6/bbac481/6831005), [Ratajczak](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12859-022-04608-y.pdf)) that only keep node types like Drug, Gene/Gene Products, and Diseases, as well as a few relationships. This not only decreases the knowledge graph size, but also decreases the memory footprint and time to train a model. In our observation, it seems that the target prediction performance for a knowledge graph embedding model improved. For example, the best performing TransE model had a hits\_at\_10 of 0.4168 vs 0.4870 after hyperparameter optimization on the full dataset and the miniturized one, respectively.
