# Drug Repurposing using Consilience of Knowledge Graph Completion Methods
This repository is a fork of [Sun et. al](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkgEQnRqYQ) implementation of four knowledge graph embedding models. Here we apply the aforementioned algorithms to a biomedical knowledge graph called MIND ([**M**echRepoNet](https://github.com/SuLab/MechRepoNet) with [DrugCentral](https://drugcentral.org/) **ind**ications). We report the results of our analysis in this [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.12.540594v3).

## Modifications to the original repository
* Added code to output raw embeddings in order to extract predictions. This can be seen with the `--do_predict` flag in `kge/codes/run.py`.
* Added Notebooks folder that encapsulates analysis done on the MIND dataset.
* Added methods, `Notebooks/score_utils.py`, to process and translate raw embeddings into human readable entities and relations.

## Usage instructions
1. Please see the original PyTorch implementation instructions
2. Download the [MIND dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/8117748) to `./data` with
```bash
   # run in shell
   bash download.sh
```
3. Install requirements into python virtual environment
   ```bash
   # run in shell
   mamba create -f environment.yml
   mamba activate kge
   
   ``` 
4. Run notebooks in `./Notebooks`
